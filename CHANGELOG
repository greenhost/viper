CHANGELOG

== R5
* Added auto-connect when client is already configured
* Check for TAP/TUN drivers on startup
* Report with a baloon tooltip when the status goes from CONNECTED to DISCONNECTED so users are aware that they are no longer under a secure connection.
* Installer no includes a third party TAP/TUN driver for windows
* Removed console window from systray client (was used for debugging only)
