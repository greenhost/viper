CHANGELOG

== b7 (mamba)
* Disable IPv6 support upon installation
* Prevent the execution of multiple instances
* Acknowledge false OpenVPN starts due to bad configuration


== b6
* Added auto-connect when client is already configured
* Check for TAP/TUN drivers on startup
* Report with a baloon tooltip when the status goes from CONNECTED to DISCONNECTED so users are aware that they are no longer under a secure connection.
* Installer now includes a third party TAP/TUN driver for windows
* Removed console window from systray client (was used for debugging only)
