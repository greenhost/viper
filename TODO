* I can't see the log at the moment. At least not from the menu.


* Write parser for "status" response from the management socket so that we can tell the
  user about usage and other metrics.

Sample output from the "status" command:
================
OpenVPN STATISTICS

* How to implement a timeout callback, like in javascript?
		import threading

		def hello(arg):
		    print arg

		t = threading.Timer(2, hello, ["bb"])
		t.start()

		while 1:
		    pass
		You're seeing "b" because you're not giving it an array, so it treats "bb" an an iterable; it's essentially as if you gave it ["b", "b"].

		kwargs is for keyword arguments, eg:

		t = threading.Timer(2, hello, ["bb"], {arg: 1})
		See http://docs.python.org/release/1.5.1p1/tut/keywordArgs.html for information about keyword arguments.


* Is there some simple signal library in python?

* Auto-connect on start-up
* Decouple from OpenVPN so that the underlaying VPN software can be swapped any time.
* Check for updates


TEST
* start viper, stop windows service
	questions: what is reported to the user? 

* kill the openvpn process while Viper is running
	questions:
		does Viper report the connection status correctly?

* shut down computer without exiting Viper
	questions:
		is the lock file still in the user directory?

* put computer to sleep, see what happens when it comes back
	what should happen: 
		openVPN continues to run and the viper client reports the connection as locked.

* while running viper, disconnect computer from network
	questions: 
		1. what is reported to the user?
		2. what happens when we put the cable back in and how is that reported to the user?

* disconnect computer from network, start viper.
	what should happen: 
		1. user is warned that no network connection is active
		2. openvpn isn't started (otherwise it will stall)? (unless it kicks right in after a network connection is opened)
