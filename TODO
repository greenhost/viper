* I can't see the log at the moment. At least not from the menu.
* Write parser for "status" response from the management socket so that we can tell the user about usage and other metrics.
* Auto-connect on start-up
* Decouple from OpenVPN so that the underlaying VPN software can be swapped any time.
* Check for updates


TEST
* start viper, stop windows service
	questions: what is reported to the user? 

* kill the openvpn process while Viper is running
	questions:
		does Viper report the connection status correctly?

* shut down computer without exiting Viper
	questions:
		is the lock file still in the user directory?

* put computer to sleep, see what happens when it comes back
	what should happen: 
		openVPN continues to run and the viper client reports the connection as locked.

* while running viper, disconnect computer from network
	questions: 
		1. what is reported to the user?
		2. what happens when we put the cable back in and how is that reported to the user?

* disconnect computer from network, start viper.
	what should happen: 
		1. user is warned that no network connection is active
		2. openvpn isn't started (otherwise it will stall)? (unless it kicks right in after a network connection is opened)
